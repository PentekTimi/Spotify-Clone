## Overview

Built a Spotify clone website using React, with a focus on achieving pixel-perfect design and clean, well-organized HTML and CSS code. The project was built in mind with creating reusable components. The font family used by Spotify is not available to the public, the reason why there might be slight space differences due to a different font.

Note: the page does not include interactivity and was created for desktop view only!
